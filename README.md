# E-commerce Project - Shopifyn

This project is an e-commerce application built using React.js, Vite, Firebase, Material UI, and Yarn. It provides various features for browsing and purchasing products, as well as authentication and user management capabilities.

## Features

1. **Filters**: Users can sort products by price (low/high), rating, and apply filters based on a specific rating or price range.
2. **Protected Routes**: Certain actions, such as adding products to the cart, require authentication. Users must be logged in to perform these actions.
3. **Quantity Management**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of products in their cart.
4. **Search**: The application allows users to search for any product using a search bar.
5. **Authentication**: Three authentication methods are available: guest login, email and password authentication, and Google login.

## To-Do

The following features are planned for future development:

1. **Wish Listing**: Add the ability for users to create and manage wish lists.
2. **Order History**: Implement a feature that displays the user's order history, allowing them to track past purchases.
3. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate a payment gateway to enable secure online payments.

5. Create a Firebase project and obtain the configuration details (API keys, project ID, etc.).
6. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values with your Firebase configuration.
7. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   yarn dev
   ```
